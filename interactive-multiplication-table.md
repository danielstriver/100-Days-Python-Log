# Interactive Multiplication Table. 

### *This is a program that  enables users to easily learn multiplication tables through interactive question and answer mode*

## How it works

- The program asks the user which multiplication table they want to practice.
- The program will ask the user to answer the multiplication itself and it'll let them know whether they got it right or wrong.
- The program tells they user how many they got right at the end out of 12.
- The user gets an inspirational congrats message when they get all answers right.

### **This program is inspired by the courage to help my nieces lock in Math Knowledge**

### *NB: Check out the code in the InteractiveMultiplicationTable.py file. Stay Hard!*
